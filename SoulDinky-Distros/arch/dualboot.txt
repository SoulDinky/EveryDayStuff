mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sda5

mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda6

mkdir /mnt/archinstall

mount /dev/sda6 /mnt/archinstall    (main partition)

mkdir /mnt/archinstall/boot

mount /dev/sda5 /mnt/archinstall/boot  (boot partition)

archinstall

disk configuration pre-mounted  enter the root direct of the mounted devices: /mnt/archinstall



after installation chroot before rebooting

mkdir /mnt/win10

mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/win10     should mount the 100M sda partition

cd /mnt/win10

ls   should see EFI

cd EFI
